# Stylye

The idea is to build a shopping application for clothes, displaying men's, women's and children's products, putting the products in the shopping cart and then paying them, using artificial intelligence when seeing a piece of clothing, we give the user the ability to measure the product by placing his image, then a new image will appear about the combination of the image of the user wearing the piece of clothing he chose. 
(P.T The app is only proccessing on women pictures and we but only demo because the server is limited storage and duration Time )
